# Robot-Arm-Control-using-joint_state_publisher-and-MoveIt-with-Kinematics
This repository explains controlling a robot arm using ROS tools such as joint_state_publisher and MoveIt. These tools enable the simulation, visualization, and precise kinematic control of the robot arm's movements. Key topics include setting up joint_state_publisher and configuring MoveIt.

## Repository Fork Details
